   ```
3. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) to access the FastAPI Swagger UI.
4. To register a face:

   * Click on the `/api/face/register` section.
   * Click the "Try it out" button.
   * Upload your image and click "Execute".
5. To recognize a face:

   * Click on the `/api/face/recognize` section.
   * Click the "Try it out" button.

## Notes

To ensure accurate and reliable face recognition results, please follow these image guidelines:

- ‚úÖ Use a **clear, front-facing image** of the person's face.
- ‚úÖ Ensure the **face is centered** in the image and fully visible.
- ‚úÖ Use **good lighting** (avoid shadows or overexposure).
- ‚úÖ Upload images with **moderate distance** ‚Äî not too close, not too far.
- ‚úÖ Only **one face per image** is recommended.

Avoid:

- ‚ùå Blurry or low-resolution images
- ‚ùå Faces with sunglasses, heavy makeup, or masks
- ‚ùå Side profiles or extreme angles
- ‚ùå Group photos with multiple faces

Following these suggestions will help the model generate better embeddings and improve recognition accuracy.
